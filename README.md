## Objective
Develop a data science pipeline to detect anomalous (fradulent) credit card transactions with the use of:
- Isolation forest machine learning model - For unsupervised anomaly detection
- Kedro - An open-source Python framework for creating reproducible, maintainable, and modular data science code. This framework helps to accelerate data pipelining, enhance data science prototyping, and promote pipeline reproducibility.)

## Motivation
- Explore how unsupervised anomaly detection works, and better understand the concept and implementation of isolation forest
- Leverage Kedro framework to optimally structure the data science pipeline project

## Data
The [credit card transaction data](https://github.com/Fraud-Detection-Handbook/simulated-data-transformed) is obtained from the collaboration between Worldline and Machine Learning Group. It is a realistic simulation of real-world credit card transactions and has been designed to include complicated fraud detection issues.
